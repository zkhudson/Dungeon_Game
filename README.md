# Dungeon_Game
This is a script that I wrote for a Treehouse exercise using Python.  This
script creates a game with a 2-dimensional map.  It places a player, a
door, and a monster into random locations on the map.  The player moves
around in the map and, after each move, they are told whether they
found the door or the monster.  If they find either the game is over.
The door is the win condition and the monster is the lose condition.
